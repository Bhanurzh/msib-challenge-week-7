# Challenge Week 7 - Event-Driven Calculator

In Node.js, an event emitter provides a mechanism for emitting and listening to custom events in a Node.js application. Event emitters are at the core of event-driven programming in Node.js, enabling you to build applications that respond to events asynchronously.

In this challenge, we have incomplete operations for the calculator. Your task is to complete the missing operations of the calculator, such as `subtraction`, `multiplication`, `division`, and `exponential`.

## Steps
1. Build a Node.js calculator using event emitters for operation selection.
2. Support `subtraction`, `multiplication`, `division`, and `exponential`.
3. Write unit tests for calculator functions using Mocha and Chai.
4. Implement a transform stream to multiply test results by 2.
5. Write the transformed results to an `output.txt` file.
